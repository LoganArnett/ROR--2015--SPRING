* [The Official Ruby on Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/index.html) Many of these will be useful 
references once we get to Rails. There's a lot of vocabulary involved in Rails, and I'll be using it and explaining 
it each day, but it will be nice to have the information written down somewhere you can review - and even read ahead, 
maybe.

* [ASCII Casts](http://asciicasts.com/) Once upon a time there was a terrific resource called RailsCasts, which had 5-10 min videos set up by Ryan Bates (not Brian Gates, Ryan Bates). Then to help people who preferred to read, a dude in Wales set up this 
site with transcripts and some screen shots of the videos. Unfortunately, Ryan Bates burned out on the 
whole project about a year and a half ago, so it's kind of dated. Still a decent place to see a lot of
code written out and explained, even if some of it depends on older versions of Rails and no longer works.

* http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ from the same guy who wrote the command line tutorial you did in prework; not
a bad way to get some repetitions in. Zed Shaw is really big on the Karate Kid style of learning - you don't go to 
anything advanced until you've spent six months painting the fence and proved you can kick the evil blond kid in the
face. (Speaking of which, [love this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3iYmgDJ4FE))

* [Book recommendations](http://www.justinweiss.com/blog/2014/09/22/can-you-learn-rails-before-learning-ruby/)
I don't know this guy, but I agree with him (as you may have noticed).

* [Reinforcement of this week](http://matthewcarriere.com/2008/06/23/using-select-reject-collect-inject-and-detect/)
Just stumbled across this nice discussion of some stuff we were doing this week.

* [Code Wars](http://codewars.com) This is a neat source of small-to-midsized coding challenges. 
The best part of the site is reading through the comments on each problem (after you solve it) 
to see the other solutions people have come up with.

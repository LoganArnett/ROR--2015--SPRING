# 03 -- Method to the Madness

## Description

Three programming challenges for today:

* Extend your Fixnum#to_roman method to work up to 2015.

* A factorial of an integer is the product of all positive integers up to and including that integer. For example 6 factorial = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1. Write a method on the `Fixnum` class which returns the factorial of a number.

* Write a method on the `Fixnum` class to convert a number to its name in English.

* EXPERT LEVEL: Write a function that can do addition or multiplication in English. For example given "twenty three times seventy eight", it should return "one thousand seven hundred ninety four".

* SUPER EXPERT LEVEL: Write a function that can do any basic arithmetic operation - addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division - in English, accepting a string as input and returning one as output.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should begin to understand how to:

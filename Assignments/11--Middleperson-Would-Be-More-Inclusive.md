# 11 -- Middleperson Would Be More Inclusive

## Description

Website building time. This entire assignment could conceivably be done purely in HTML. That would be less fun, though.

Spend the weekend builing a site (by which I mean, a collection of web pages) that describes everything you know about Ruby and web development to this point. Possible topics include data types, logic operators, methods, objects, classes, testing, OOP and TDD, git, GitHub, HTML, CSS, code editors, command line tools, useful websites, blogs, gems.... There are lots of things you could write about. Discuss a problem you solved(/attempted) and what you learned from it. Illustrate methods and classes with better examples than [the main Ruby site](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/) gives you. Talk about Middleman, and what you learned about Middleman over the weekend.

Use Middleman to build the site. There's a lot to that project. Play around with it. Maybe try HAML. See what's useful or neat, and use it and write about it.

Use new and unfamiliar HTML tags. Go crazy. Embed a video of Prince singing "Let's Go Crazy". Make interesting page transition effects in CSS. You should not get stuck on this project. You should just run out of time.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

Master just enough HTML and CSS to make a decent looking website, and understand some of the tools Middleman offers to make the process of building your website easier.

### Performance Objectives

Make a site that shows what you know.

### Deliverables

* a `/html` directory with many pages

#### Tasks

* Sketch out ideas for how to organize your site
* Read up on what Middleman can do for you
* Sketch out what different pages in your site might look like/contain
* Decide how fancy-looking you can reasonably expect to get in a weekend
* Write a lot of erb/html which reflects everything you know about this stuff

Of course you can add subtasks in here as appropriate.
